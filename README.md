<br/>
<br/>

To achieve this goal, you will have to respect a few rules:

- **You cannot watch, read, inspect or copy original sources from _webviews_caa_**
- **You cannot copy other sources**
- For each step, create a branch _(refer to the branch name in the step)_, commit your work for each new _feature_, and push it when you think it is done.

> ðŸš¨ Be careful, we'll know it

But, you can, and it is recommended to:

- **Ask your mates for advices, tips, ...**
- **Read documentation and watch how other developers do on codebase websites**

> Your favorites documentation websites: [React](https://fr.reactjs.org/), [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Mozilla Developer Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/JavaScript) and [StackOverFlow](https://stackoverflow.com/)

## Steps

To achieve the main goal, you will follow steps:

#### 1. Render with React ?

> _Git branch:_ **sprint1/render-with-react**<br/> > _Estimed time:_ **45mn/1h**

React.js offers multiples ways to render virtual **DOM** _(what is DOM?)_.

- React Class Component
- React Functionnal Component

In this step, you will have to render, in a `Fragment`, the component like below.

> Think about your code splitting. Will you use a Class or a function to render your components?
